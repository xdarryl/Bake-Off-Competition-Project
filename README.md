# Bake Off Competition using C
Project developed in CS 452

# Project Description 
This project will focus on using the C programming language to learn and develop a project with semaphores, threads, and shared memory. In order to do so, we will base our project on the concept of a baking competition. This project is a proof of concept and was intended to challenge our understanding and work with something we haven't before within our operating systems.

# How to Build
To build and run this project, follow the steps below:
```
# Open a terminal (Command Prompt or Powershell for Windows OS, and for macOS or Linux use Terminal)

# Ensure Git is install on the machine
# Visit https://github.com/git-guides/install-git for processes on how to do so

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/xdarryl/CS452-Bake-Off-Project-Two.git

# Once on your system, cd into the folder

# Compile the project with gcc
# If gcc is not installed; https://gcc.gnu.org/install for processes on how to do so
gcc bakeoff.c

# Use the ./ synax with the output to run the project
./a.out 
```

# Documentation
Documentation is found within the project file.

# TODO
This project could be advance upon in various ways, we filled the requirements for the initial criteria\
However here are some things (not everything) that would/could be a lot better:
- Create a header file for our functions to separate functions from our main file
- Have better output results, as of now the output just feels overwhelming but does produce correctness of what we want
- Error checking, not much of that in there could be useful to ensure that things are being created correctly and can't be messed with otherwise
